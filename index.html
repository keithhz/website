        this is my first website and im <b>extremly excited</b>
        <h1>My First Website</h1>

        <h2>A playground</h2>
        <p>She'd take the world off my shoulders
            If it was ever hard to move
            She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
            When I was living in the blue
            Why then, if she is so perfect
            Do I still wish that it was you?
            Perfect don't mean that it's working
            So what can I do? (Ooh)
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're out of sight
        In my mind 
            
        </p>
        <p> 
            'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br><br><br>
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us
        And I try to fall for her touch
        But I'm thinking of the way it was
        <hr> I'm fine and said I moved on
        I'm only here passing time in her arms
        Hoping I'll find
        A glimpse of us
        </p>
